# Japanese Lesson Materials for TV Takeshi channel

This is the GitHub repository for Japanese lesson materials used for [TV Takeshi channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3PLjXdqVn46gZGEpfllfg).

# Presentation slides

Each folder contains the `.pdf`, `.tex`, and font files.

- Most of learners will probably need only `.pdf`, but I added the `.tex` in case anyone would like to contribute to the improvement.
- Compiling `.tex` to the `.pdf` requires XeLaTeX.
- IPAexGothic (`ipaexg.ttf`) and IPAexMincho (`ipaexm.ttf`) fonts are used for Japanese fonts in the slides.
